Define password authentication as authentication mechanism. This is considered as the weakest authentication method if you don’t plan to use a very strong password using the secure password guidelines:

At least 10 characters.
Use both uppercase and lowercase characters.
Include numbers.
Include at least one special character.
Be sure it is not present in any public wordlist or used in any known leaks.
Using a password generator is recommended, this option might be available in a future version of SubSeven.

The password must be defined as a SHA512 hex strings with a salt (see bellow schema).

You can whether use the embedded Password Hash Generator available in Configuration Editor or use bellow schema for generating your own hash.

sha512(sha512(cleartext_password) + 'sub7legacy_salt')

Salt is used to turn rainbow tables and hash tables unusable with SubSeven Legacy. The salt might become dynamic in future version of SubSeven.

When you are ready, you can place your password hash in a new JSON key value called password.

Example:

…
"authentication": {
	"method": "password",
	"password": "b903e233900a2…381d3bd9b19"
}
…
